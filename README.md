# tombOfHorrorsPlan
This is a Python Django based web site. The contents are based on Tomb of Horrors, a Dungeons and Dragons module written by the great Gary Gygax and released in 1978. The purpoose of the site is twofold. First, to work with Django (1.11 - an older version) to create a working interractive website. The second, and primary reason, is to drive the concepts of Test Driven Design.

Two test files currently exist in the project. functional_test.py in the root folder test that the site works as intended. tombApp/tests.py hold unit tests checking contents of files and when page functionality is added.
